  Nuvoton, NPCM PCC (Power and Clock Controller) node.
  Besides power management, this node is also in charge of configuring the
  Oscillator Frequency Multiplier Clock (OFMCLK), which is derived from
  High-Frequency Clock Generator (HFCG), is the source clock of Cortex-M4 core
  and most of NPCM hardware modules.

  Here is an example of configuring OFMCLK and the other clock sources derived
  from it in board dts file.
  &pcc {
      clock-frequency = <DT_FREQ_M(96)>; /* OFMCLK runs at 96MHz */
      core-prescaler = <1>; /* CORE_CLK runs at 96MHz */
      apb1-prescaler = <8>; /* APB1_CLK runs at 12MHz */
      apb2-prescaler = <1>; /* APB2_CLK runs at 96MHz */
      apb3-prescaler = <1>; /* APB3_CLK runs at 96MHz */
  };
