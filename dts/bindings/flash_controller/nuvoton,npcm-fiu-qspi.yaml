    Properties defining the NPCM Quad-SPI peripheral of Flash Interface Unit (FIU).
    A npcm quad-fiu-spi dt node would typically looks like:

        &qspi_fiu0 {
            status = "okay";

            int_flash: w25q400@0 {
                status = "okay";
                reg = <0>;
                ...
            };

            ext_flash: w25q256@1 {
                status = "okay";
                reg = <1>;
                ...
            };
        };

    `int_flash` and `ext_flash` are the devices accessed by this peripheral.
